# Active Directory Users and Organizational Units Setup

**Objective:** We will be creating Organizational Units (OU) for our company, and then we’ll be adding users and groups to the respective OU’s. We’ll do this Using Active Directory and Windows Server and we’ll verify the setup in Windows 10.


**Scenario:** We need to create user accounts, groups, and OUs under the labscholas.local domain. Specifically, we are requested to:

- Add 9 users
- Create the following Organizational Units:

  - OU - Chicago
    - Sub OU  Accounting
        - Sub OU Users
     -  Sub OU Purchasing
        - Sub OU Users
     -  Sub OU Quality Assurance
        - Sub OU Users

While we’ve used our own names and structures, this project is general enough to be used to create your own Active Directory system.

Active Directory (AD) is used to manage and organize users, computers, and resources within a network. It acts as a centralized system where administrators can create user accounts, manage permissions, and set up policies for different departments. This ensures that each user has the appropriate access to resources and that the network remains secure and efficient. By centralizing everything, AD simplifies the management of a company's IT infrastructure.

## Step 1: Users

Boot up the Windows 2016 Server VM and load the Server Manager. To manage user objects, groups, and computers, first click on "Tools" in the top right corner and then select "Active Directory Users and Computers."

This window allows us to manage all our user objects, groups, and computers. To create a new user, right-click on the labscholas.local domain, then choose "New" > "User."

To enter a new user, fill in the user's first and last name fields. Set the User logon name as the first letter of the user's first name, followed by a dot, and then the user's last name, all in lowercase. Once completed, click "Next."

</div>


Enter a temporary password: Pass1234! Ensure the option for the user to change the password at the next logon is selected. IT admins do not need to know the user's password and shouldn't; it can always be reset from the server if needed. Once completed, click "Next", then click “Finish”.

We’re going to repeat the process to add a few more users:


- Joe Musashi
- Mario Mario
- Terra Branford
- Cloud Strife
- Yugi Moto
- Yusuke Urameshi
- Simon Belmont
- Leon Kennedy

Do you notice anything curious about these names?

When you’ve completed inputting the names and info, here is what you should see:

## STEP 2: Organizational Units

Next, we will create our Organizational Units. An Organizational Unit (OU) in Active Directory is a component that keeps users, computers, and resources neatly organized within a company. It’s similar to a digital filing system, where you create folders for different departments like HR, IT, and Finance. This organization allows you to easily apply specific settings or policies, such as security rules or software installations, to each group. It also lets certain people manage their department's resources without impacting the entire organization, making the administration more efficient and secure.

First, navigate to the labscholas.local domain. Choose “New,” and then click on “Organizational Unit.”

Enter “Chicago” into the text box that appears and then click ok.

<div align="center">

</div>

We’re going to create a few more OU’s under Chicago. Create them so that they follow the below structure:

## STEP 3: Groups Part 1

Next, let's create a user group for everyone at the Chicago location. A group is utilized to manage users and their access to resources. Just as you might list members of different project teams in a company, you can create groups for various purposes, like departments or projects. This makes it easier to assign permissions, apply policies, and manage security settings collectively, rather than individually. 

Right-click on the “Chicago” OU, and create a new group.


[![AD-9.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wT23PkXS/AD-9.png)](https://postimg.cc/svBVG70c)

In the box that appears, enter “GRP_CHICAGO_Users” as the group name and hit “OK”.

<div align="center">
<img src=https://i.postimg.cc/cLJ6N8T6/AD-10.png" >
</div>

To add users to the new group, start by selecting the domain “labscholas.local.” This will reveal the users you previously created in the left pane.

[![AD-11.png](https://i.postimg.cc/SRqN1XJS/AD-11.png)](https://postimg.cc/dkHYLV2p)

Highlight the users, then right click and choose “Add to a group…”

[![AD-12.png](https://i.postimg.cc/x80nyW4q/AD-12.png)](https://postimg.cc/1nYkyYPZ)

Type GRP into the “Enter the object names to select” field. Then click on “Check Names”

<div align="center">

</div>

GRP_CHICAGO_Users should appear in the text box. Click “OK” and then click “OK” on the confirmation message.

<div align="center">

</div>

Let’s verify that the users are in the GRP_CHICAGO_Users. Navigate to the Chicago OU, right clicking on the group, select “Properties”, and click the “Members” tab.

## STEP 4: Moving Users to department OUs

Now that we’ve set up our Organizational Units (OUs) to organize domain objects and resources, it's time to place our users into their respective OUs. Since the users we added are from the Chicago site and belong to different departments, we’ll move them accordingly. To do this, navigate back to the “labscholas.local” domain, select the users Cloud Strife, Joe Musashi, and Leon Kennedy, right-click on their names, and choose “Move…”

[![AD-16.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GmRVBk6h/AD-16.png)](https://postimg.cc/w7W0Zs6S)

Expand the “Chicago” OU, then the “Accounting” OU, and then select the “Users” OU and hit “OK”.

[![AD-17.png](https://i.postimg.cc/t4RDQDLP/AD-17.png)](https://postimg.cc/w7PDD5xT)

Repeat the above process to place the remaining users in their OU’s according to the below list:



- Terra Branford - Purchasing
- Yugi Moto - Purchasing
- Yusuke Urameshi - Purchasing
- Simon Belmont - Quality Assurance
- Samus Aran - Quality Assurance
- Mario Mario - Quality Assurance

## STEP 5: Groups Part 2


Now, let’s create user groups to group the users of each department. This will allow for easy management of users within the departments Navigate to the “Chicago” > ”Accounting” > ”Users” OU. Right-click, and select “New”  and then “Group”.

[![AD-18.png](https://i.postimg.cc/sDtKtGkz/AD-18.png)](https://postimg.cc/zVFnhvD2)

Enter “GRP_Accounting_Users” into the “Group name:” text box and then click “OK”.

<div align="center">
<img src=https://i.postimg.cc/pr3Yb31C/AD-19.png" >
</div>

Repeat the above process for the users in Purchasing and Quality Assurance. Note that you’ll have to create their respective groups as well.

## STEP 6: Verifying Logon

Run the Windows 10 VM and Select “Other User”

![AD-20.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XYfKmHKK/AD-20.png)

Let’s Select the user “Cloud Strife” to login. Recall that the username will be “c.strife” and the password will be “Pass1234!”. We will immediately be prompted to enter a new password and after submitting the password, it will take several minutes to set up the new account so just sit tight.

After the account finishes setting up, you will already be logged in.

Navigate to the windows 10 search bar at the bottom and type in “about” and hit enter. Use the below image to see if you’ve correctly added the PC to the Active Directory Domain.

And that’s it! You have successfully set up an Active Directory system!
