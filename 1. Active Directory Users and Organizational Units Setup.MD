# Active Directory Users and Organizational Units Setup

**Objective:** We will be creating Organizational Units (OU) for our company, and then we’ll be adding users and groups to the respective OU’s. We’ll do this Using Active Directory and Windows Server and we’ll verify the setup in Windows 10.


**Scenario:** We need to create user accounts, groups, and OUs under the labscholas.local domain. Specifically, we are requested to:

- Add 9 users
- Create the following Organizational Units:

  - OU - Chicago
    - Sub OU  Accounting
        - Sub OU Users
     -  Sub OU Purchasing
        - Sub OU Users
     -  Sub OU Quality Assurance
        - Sub OU Users

While we’ve used our own names and structures, this project is general enough to be used to create your own Active Directory system.

Active Directory (AD) is used to manage and organize users, computers, and resources within a network. It acts as a centralized system where administrators can create user accounts, manage permissions, and set up policies for different departments. This ensures that each user has the appropriate access to resources and that the network remains secure and efficient. By centralizing everything, AD simplifies the management of a company's IT infrastructure.

## Step 1: Users

Boot up the Windows 2016 Server VM and load the Server Manager. To manage user objects, groups, and computers, first click on "Tools" in the top right corner and then select "Active Directory Users and Computers."

This window allows us to manage all our user objects, groups, and computers. To create a new user, right-click on the labscholas.local domain, then choose "New" > "User."

To enter a new user, fill in the user's first and last name fields. Set the User logon name as the first letter of the user's first name, followed by a dot, and then the user's last name, all in lowercase. Once completed, click "Next."

Enter a temporary password: Pass1234! Ensure the option for the user to change the password at the next logon is selected. IT admins do not need to know the user's password and shouldn't; it can always be reset from the server if needed. Once completed, click "Next", then click “Finish”.

We’re going to repeat the process to add a few more users:


- Joe Musashi
- Mario Mario
- Terra Branford
- Cloud Strife
- Yugi Moto
- Yusuke Urameshi
- Simon Belmont
- Leon Kennedy

Do you notice anything curious about these names?

When you’ve completed inputting the names and info, here is what you should see:

## STEP 2: Organizational Units

Next, we will create our Organizational Units. An Organizational Unit (OU) in Active Directory is a component that keeps users, computers, and resources neatly organized within a company. It’s similar to a digital filing system, where you create folders for different departments like HR, IT, and Finance. This organization allows you to easily apply specific settings or policies, such as security rules or software installations, to each group. It also lets certain people manage their department's resources without impacting the entire organization, making the administration more efficient and secure.

First, navigate to the labscholas.local domain. Choose “New,” and then click on “Organizational Unit.”
