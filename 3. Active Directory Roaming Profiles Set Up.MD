# Active Directory Roaming Profiles Set Up 🧑‍💻

**Objective:** We will be setting up Roaming Profiles on Windows Server, which involves creating and sharing a folder for storing user profiles, and linking this folder to user accounts. Finally, we will verify that users' settings and files are accessible from any networked computer.

Roaming Profiles allows users to log in from any workstation within the network and find their desktop settings, documents, and application preferences just as they left them. This is especially useful for employees who work from different locations or need to switch computers frequently. For example, if a user customizes their desktop wallpaper and saves important documents on their desktop, these changes and files will appear exactly the same when they log in from another computer.

## Step 1: Create Folder

Turn on the Windows 2016 Server VM and create a folder named “Roaming Profile” on the C: drive following these steps:

- Open File Explorer and navigate to the C: drive.
- Right-click, select "New," then "Folder."
- Name the folder “Roaming Profile.”

We are going to use the “Our Users” Query we created in the previous guide to choose all the users will be allowed to have a roaming profile(all of them in this case). Highlight all the users, then right click and choose “Properties” from the menu.

Next, navigate to the “Profile” tab in the “Properties for Multiple Items dialog box and check the “Profile Path” check box. Enter the path \\\Server1\Roaming Profile\%username% in the field next to it and click “OK”. Note that “%username%” is an environment variable

To verify if roaming profiles are working correctly, start by rebooting the Windows 10 VM and logging in with a domain user created during the first part of this project, here. If this is the user’s first login, you'll need to set the password, and it will take Windows several moments to boot up. Once the desktop appears, switch back to the Windows Server 2016 Lab and open the “Roaming Profile” folder. If you see a new folder named after the user with a ‘.V6’ at the end, it means roaming profiles are working as intended. This ensures that the user can access their personalized environment and desktop from any computer registered on the domain.

This concludes the project! Users may now to log in from any workstation within the network and find their desktop settings, documents, and application preferences just as they left them.
