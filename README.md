Active Directory (AD) is a crucial tool used by company’s to secure and organize their networks. When a user logs into a PC at work and has instant access to files, printers, and applications, that’s likely an AD configuration that allows users access to what they need.

Key advantages of AD include streamlined access control, where IT can quickly grant or revoke access to resources, and centralized management of user accounts and devices.

In this particular project, I used a Windows Server 2016 Virtual Machine (VM) to configure an AD environment and a Windows 10 Pro VM to test configurations I made. I start by setting up users and Organizational Units (OU) and then gradually adding functionality. To best undersand this project, I suggest going through each of the below sections in this repo in order:

- **1.** [Active Directory Users and Organizational Units Setup](https://github.com/cybersecfaizan/Active-Directory-Ecosystem/blob/main/1.%20Active%20Directory%20Users%20and%20Organizational%20Units%20Setup.MD)
- **2.** [Active Directory Shared Folder](https://github.com/cybersecfaizan/Active-Directory-Ecosystem/blob/main/2.%20Active%20Directory%20Shared%20Folder.MD)
- **3.** [Active Directory Roaming Profiles Set Up](https://github.com/cybersecfaizan/Active-Directory-Ecosystem/blob/main/3.%20Active%20Directory%20Roaming%20Profiles%20Set%20Up.MD)
