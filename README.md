# Active Directory Project 

Active Directory (AD) is a crucial tool used by company’s to secure and organize their networks. When you log in to your computer at work and instantly access files, printers, and applications, that’s AD managing your permissions and ensuring you have what you need.

Key advantages of AD include streamlined access control, where IT can quickly grant or revoke access to resources, and centralized management of user accounts and devices.

In this particular project, I used a Windows Server 2016 Virtual Machine (VM) to configure an AD environment and a Windows 10 Pro VM to test configurations I made.
