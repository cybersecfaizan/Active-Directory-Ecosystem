# Active Directory Shared Folder

**Objective:** We'll be creating and sharing a "Public" folder on a Windows Server, ensuring that all members of the "Domain Users" group can access it from any computer on the network. We'll set up the folder on the server, configure permissions, map it to users as a network drive (Q:), and then verify that everything works as intended using a Winfows 10 VM.

A user might use the "Public" folder to efficiently store and share important files, making it easier for team members to access and collaborate without relying on email. It can also serve as a centralized location for shared resources like templates or company policies, ensuring everyone has access to the latest versions. Additionally, the folder can be used for backing up critical data and collaborating on projects in real-time. An administrator might further refine access permissions to ensure that only authorized users can modify files, while others can view them as needed.

## Step 1: Create Folder

Create a folder named “Public” on the C: drive of the Win 2016 Server  following these steps:

- Open File Explorer and navigate to the C: drive.
- Right-click, select "New," then "Folder."
- Name the folder “Public”

This is for demonstration only. In a live environment, it is not recommended to set up network shares from the C: drive of a server. Instead, add a secondary hard drive and use it for all shares. This keeps the data on the C: drive protected.

We’d like to allow any member of the “Domain Users” group to access the folder. In order to do this, Right-click the “Public” folder, select “Properties,” and go to the “Sharing” tab. Click the “Advanced Sharing” button.

Now, click the “Add…” button. Enter “Domain” into the “Enter the object names to select (examples):” text box, then click the “Check Names” button. Select the “Domain Users” group from the “Matching names:” list and click “OK”.
