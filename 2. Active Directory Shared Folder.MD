# Active Directory Shared Folder 📁

**Objective:** We'll be creating and sharing a "Public" folder on a Windows Server, ensuring that all members of the "Domain Users" group can access it from any computer on the network. We'll set up the folder on the server, configure permissions, map it to users as a network drive (Q:), and then verify that everything works as intended using a Winfows 10 VM.

A user might use the "Public" folder to efficiently store and share important files, making it easier for team members to access and collaborate without relying on email. It can also serve as a centralized location for shared resources like templates or company policies, ensuring everyone has access to the latest versions. Additionally, the folder can be used for backing up critical data and collaborating on projects in real-time. An administrator might further refine access permissions to ensure that only authorized users can modify files, while others can view them as needed.

## Step 1: Create Folder

Create a folder named “Public” on the C: drive of the Win 2016 Server  following these steps:

- Open File Explorer and navigate to the C: drive.
- Right-click, select "New," then "Folder."
- Name the folder “Public”

This is for demonstration only. In a live environment, it is not recommended to set up network shares from the C: drive of a server. Instead, add a secondary hard drive and use it for all shares. This keeps the data on the C: drive protected.

We’d like to allow any member of the “Domain Users” group to access the folder. In order to do this, Right-click the “Public” folder, select “Properties,” and go to the “Sharing” tab. Click the “Advanced Sharing” button.

</div>

Next, Tick the "Share this folder" check box, ensure "Public" is the "Share name," and click the "Permissions" button. In the "Groups or user names" text box, select "Everyone," then click the "Remove" button.

</div>

Now, click the “Add…” button. Enter “Domain” into the “Enter the object names to select (examples):” text box, then click the “Check Names” button. Select the “Domain Users” group from the “Matching names:” list and click “OK”.

Then, click “OK” on the below dialogue box:

</div>

In the “Permissions for Public” dialogue box, tick the “Full Control” check box. By doing so, the “Change” check box will also automatically be ticked. Next, click “OK” and then click “OK” again on the “Advanced Sharing” dialogue box.

In order to finish this step, click on the “Close” button on the “Public Properties” box.

## Step 2: Mapping the Shared Folder to the Domain Users

Since the users who need access to the "Public" share are spread across various OUs (See the structure we set up, <a href="https://github.com/cybersecfaizan/Active-Directory-Ecosystem/blob/main/1.%20Active%20Directory%20Users%20and%20Organizational%20Units%20Setup.MD/" target="_blank">Here</a>
, we will create queries to search for and manage them efficiently. We can take advantage of the consistent login name format used in this domain, where the first letter of the first name is followed by a dot and then the last name (For example, j.musashi).

Open “Server Manager”, click on “Tools” and click on “Active Directory Users and Computers.”

</div>

Next, right-click “Saved Queries” and select “New” and then ”Query”.

<div align="center">

</div>

Name the New Query “End Users” and add a description if you’d like. The “Query root:” is set to “..\labscholas,” meaning the search will cover the entire domain. To narrow the search to a specific OU or location, you can adjust the Query root accordingly.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/xjpV5jFK/9.png" >
</div>

In the dialogue box Select “Users, Contacts, and Groups” from the “Find” dropdown menu. Select the “Advanced” tab and click the “Field” button.

<div align="center">

</div>

Select “User”and then ”Logon Name” from the menu.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bvh7rZsj/11.png" >
</div>

From the “Condition:” dropdown menu, select “Is (exactly).” In the “Value:” field, enter “.” (star dot star), which acts as a wildcard. This will search for any logon name in the format “anything dot anything,” matching the naming convention we use for our users. Then, click the “Add” button, and then the “OK” Button.

</div>

To finish creating the new query, click “OK” on the “New Query” dialogue box.

The “Our Users” query will now appear under “Saved Queries,” and the list of users it generates will be displayed in the right pane. Since it’s saved, you can easily run this query again as needed.

</div>

Highlight all the users, then right click and choose “Properties” from the menu.

<div align="center">

</div>

In the “Properties for Multiple Items” dialogue box, head over to the “Profile” tab. Check the “Home folder” box, choose the “Connect” option, and assign the drive letter “Q:”. Map it to \\Server1\Public, which is the UNC path of the folder we created and shared earlier in this lab. Once that’s done, click “OK.”

Click “OK” on the warning below.

## Step 3: Test Mapping of "Public" Folder

To verify that the “Public” folder is accessible to any user of the specified domain, reboot or power on Windows 10 and login using the credentials of a user created in the previous project. We will be logging in as Joe Musashi, so the username would be “j.musashi” and the password, which the user will have to change when first logging in is “Pass1234!”

Open “File Explorer” and navigate to “This PC”, where you should see the “Public (\\\Server1)(Q:)” share displayed. Test it by clicking on it creating a folder for the user.

</div>

And that’s it! Users in the domain can now easily share files and resources.
